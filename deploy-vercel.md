# Ready-to-Deploy Frontend Configuration

Your frontend is now configured with the backend URL: `https://e-commerce-fs-hgba.onrender.com`

## Option 1: Deploy via Vercel Website (Recommended)
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Click "New Project"
4. Import repository: `E-Commerce-FS`
5. Configure:
   - **Root Directory:** `frontend`
   - **Framework Preset:** Create React App
6. Click "Deploy" - Environment variables are already configured!

## Option 2: Deploy via Vercel CLI
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI globally
npm i -g vercel

# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

## What's Already Configured:
✅ Backend URL set to: `https://e-commerce-fs-hgba.onrender.com`
✅ Vercel.json with proper routing for React SPA
✅ Environment variables configured
✅ Build and output directories set correctly

## After Deployment:
1. Your Vercel app will be available at: `https://your-app-name.vercel.app`
2. Test the following features:
   - Product listing
   - User authentication
   - Add to cart functionality
   - Checkout process

## Troubleshooting:
If you encounter CORS issues, make sure your backend allows your Vercel domain in CORS settings.
